Comparing the results obtain for the energy of the residual: 
  - for the same values of window length and interval, the energy is smaller for a lower prediction order.
  - When window length and interval are the closest and are the biggest, that's when the residual energy is the smallest
If the residual energy is the smallest, the resynthesized signal will be more identical to the original signal.
